In this series of Takeways: I reiterate what I learnt, summarize it and additionally share my take/thoughts on it.

I have always believed that social media instagram is not for everyone. It is too distractive and to some degree unnecessary. On the other hand, Youtube provides amazing educational value if you feed the AI (remmender system) correctly. On one such uninvited browsing session, I stumbled upon this! (AP)

- Any activity with an anticipation of immediate reward releases dopamine. On the contrary an activity where reward is too far, doesn't release enough dopamine. Hence we like to play video games or enjoy comfort food but not work on our careers or crave for healthy food.

- These days there is a lot of content on social media like youtube and others which releases dopamine throughout the day. We constantly expect rewards from it hence we keep checking our phones throughout the day.

- But you might think, its okay, this is not harming me. BUT you are wrong. Our body has mechanisms to be in homeostasis. One example of how this is achieved is, when we are in cold weather, our body shivers to generate heat, and on the other hand we sweat to cool down when it is hot outside. 

- Another way we achieve homeostasis (get into equilibrium) is by increasing the tolerance towards something. For example, a person who doesn't drink that often, gets high on a pint of beer but on other hand, a regular drinker needs more and more of it to get the same high. 

- Similarly, our body down regulates our dopamine receptors and the brain gets used to high levels of dopamine and that becomes the new normal. Our tolerance to dopamine keeps increasing due to social media, and simple activities like reading a book or or working out or studying doesn't release enough dopamine to make us happy, so we stop doing such things. Activities which don't release enough dopamine seem very boring. 


So, what's the solution? - DOPAMINE DETOX.

- What does this mean - this means "FOR JUST ONE DAY" you will not enjoy doing anything you regularly do. LIke no internet, no phone, no music and no junk food. This will help stabilize the dopamine receptors in your brain. You will embrace boredom.
However, you can do the following- go for walks, reflect on your life, meditate, write down ideas you might have (on a paper).

- This is hard, but works. Suddenly you will realize and appreciate simple things in life. Lets just block one day in a week where we put down the sources of immediate dopamine release. 

- Alternatively, lets make a list of all the difficult things we need to do (yes go and get a piece of paper to jot down things you need to do) like study something, workout, write your thoughts, clean an apartment etc. and then you can reward yourself after you tick one item off the list. 
BUT make sure you reward yourself, only AFTER ticking an item on the list and at END OF THE DAY.

For example: Suppose you spent 8 hours doing something from the list, you can assign 25% of 8 hours = 2 hours of high dopamine activity at the end of the day. This means you can be on your phone only after 8 hours but for full 2 hours! isn't that awesome?

Dopamine is good for us, but it is critical where you get it from. Are you going to get it from the stuff which is not going to benefit or are you going to get it from things which will help you in the long term.
